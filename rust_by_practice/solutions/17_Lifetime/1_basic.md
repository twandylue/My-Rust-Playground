```rust
/* Annotate the lifetime of `i` and `borrow2` */

// Lifetimes are annotated below with lines denoting the creation
// and destruction of each variable.
// `i` has the longest lifetime because its scope entirely encloses
// both `borrow1` and `borrow2`. The duration of `borrow1` compared
// to `borrow2` is irrelevant since they are disjoint.
fn main() {
    let i = 3;
    {
        let borrow1 = &i; // `borrow1` lifetime starts. ──┐
                          //                              │
        println!("borrow1: {}", borrow1); //              │
    } // `borrow1 ends. ──────────────────────────────────┘
    {
        let borrow2 = &i;

        println!("borrow2: {}", borrow2);
    }
}
```

## Function

Ignoring elision rules, lifetimes in function signatures have a few constraints:

- Any reference must have an annotated lifetime
- Any reference being returned must have the same lifetime as one of the inputs or be static

Example

```rust
// One input reference with lifetime `'a` which must live
// at least as long as the function.
fn print_one<'a>(x: &'a i32) {
    println!("`print_one`: x is {}", x);
}

// Mutable references are possible with lifetimes as well.
fn add_one<'a>(x: &'a mut i32) {
    *x += 1;
}

// Multiple elements with different lifetimes. In this case, it
// would be fine for both to have the same lifetime `'a`, but
// in more complex cases, different lifetimes may be required.
fn print_multi<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32) {
    println!("`print_multi`: x is {}, y is {}", x, y);
}

// Returning references that have been passed in is acceptable.
// However, the correct lifetime must be returned.
fn pass_x<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, _: &'b i32) -> &'a i32 { x }

fn main() {
    let x = 7;
    let y = 9;
    
    print_one(&x);
    print_multi(&x, &y);
    
    let z = pass_x(&x, &y);
    print_one(z);

    let mut t = 3;
    add_one(&mut t);
    print_one(&t);
}
```

```rust
/* Make it work by adding proper lifetime annotation */
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}

fn main() {}
```

```rust
// `'a` must live longer than the function.
// Here, `&String::from("foo")` would create a `String`, followed by a
// reference. Then the data is dropped upon exiting the scope, leaving
// a reference to invalid data to be returned.

/* Fix the error in three ways  */
fn invalid_output() -> String {
    String::from("foo")
}

fn main() {}
```

```rust
// `print_refs` takes two references to `i32` which have different
// lifetimes `'a` and `'b`. These two lifetimes must both be at
// least as long as the function `print_refs`.
fn print_refs<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32) {
    println!("x is {} and y is {}", x, y);
}

/* Make it work */
// A function which takes no arguments, but has a lifetime parameter `'a`.
fn failed_borrow<'a>() {
    let _x = 12;

    // ERROR: `_x` does not live long enough
    let y: &i32 = &_x;
    // Attempting to use the lifetime `'a` as an explicit type annotation
    // inside the function will fail because the lifetime of `&_x` is shorter
    // than `'a` . A short lifetime cannot be coerced into a longer one.
}

fn main() {
    let (four, nine) = (4, 9);

    // Borrows (`&`) of both variables are passed into the function.
    print_refs(&four, &nine);
    // Any input which is borrowed must outlive the borrower.
    // In other words, the lifetime of `four` and `nine` must
    // be longer than that of `print_refs`.

    failed_borrow();
    // `failed_borrow` contains no references to force `'a` to be
    // longer than the lifetime of the function, but `'a` is longer.
    // Because the lifetime is never constrained, it defaults to `'static`.
}
```

```rust
/* Make it work by adding proper lifetime annotation */

// A type `Borrowed` which houses a reference to an
// `i32`. The reference to `i32` must outlive `Borrowed`.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Borrowed<'a>(&'a i32);

// Similarly, both references here must outlive this structure.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct NamedBorrowed<'a> {
    x: &'a i32,
    y: &'a i32,
}

// An enum which is either an `i32` or a reference to one.
#[derive(Debug)]
enum Either<'a> {
    Num(i32),
    Ref(&'a i32),
}

fn main() {
    let x = 18;
    let y = 15;

    let single = Borrowed(&x);
    let double = NamedBorrowed { x: &x, y: &y };
    let reference = Either::Ref(&x);
    let number = Either::Num(y);

    println!("x is borrowed in {:?}", single);
    println!("x and y are borrowed in {:?}", double);
    println!("x is borrowed in {:?}", reference);
    println!("y is *not* borrowed in {:?}", number);
